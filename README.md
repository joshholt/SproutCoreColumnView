SproutCore ColumnView
=====================

This is a sandbox app that shows off the new SproutCore ColumnView

Obviously there will be places where things need tweaking and 
optimization but this will do for a few hours work :^/

Provides the following
======================

1. SC.ColumnSetView (Manages the creation/deletion of SC.ColumnView(s))
2. SC.ColumnView (A dual purpose view that displays the next branch of a tree)
3. SC.ColumnMetaDataView (A view for the times when you hit the end of a branch)
4. SC.DividerView (Not finished but the name says it all, right?)
5. SC.ColumnDelegate (Handles inter-column drag, drop, and reordering)
